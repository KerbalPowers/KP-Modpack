// BDA rebalancing configs for use with KP3:

// Generally speaking mechs are already at multiple disadvantages.  Much larger then conventional vehicles and hard to armor up without overtaxing the actuators.  Extremely high energy useage even compared to unmodified wheels on heavy vehicles.  Not like any of these changes will make mechs meta or even all that practical, but its a start to at least allow such stupid designs to at least put up a fight in a otherwise 100+ ton heavy tank dominated battlefield.

// Higher HP to prevent legs from falling off from anything but concentrated fire from autocannons or HEAT ammo.  Massively decreased electricity useage to give them something over wheels (and besides you still need a shitton of reaction wheels for most designs so those already eat power and are not exactly "cheap").  Slight buff to strength of the servos since they will be carrying far heavier loads now with armor plating on any half useable mech.  Also increased impact tolerance a bit to keep them somewhat vulnurable to high speed collisions with jeeps and the like but not break apart at the slightest touch like when hitting the ground after a jump.
