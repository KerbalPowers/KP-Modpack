// BDA rebalancing configs for use with KP3:

// General approach:

// Tweaked the costs of things based on their relative usefullness on the battlefied.  Rough template i used is ~500 for MGs, ~1000-1500 for exposed autocannons, ~3500 for most tank and high end AA turrets, and ~7000 for artillery turrets.

// HP of parts somewhat standardized to ~500 for smaller exposed MG/autocannons, ~5000 for AA turrets, ~10000 for BMP or smaller tank turrets, and ~18000 for full sized MBT turrets.

// Accuracy was buffed in general with the main change being MBT turrets going from a spread of 0.1 to ~0.05 which allows them to be effective at ~2km against a MBT sized target.  Some guns which would have never been picked before due to pathetic base stats (majority of the BDAExpanded turrets for example) were brought up to a state where they are closer to the MBT turrets to act as a sidegrade rather then a leave it at home and never look back.  There is ofc some variation between even near identical turrets with very slight tradeoffs for rate of fire or accuracy but these variations are very slight and nomatter what MBT turret you pick it will still feel like a MBT turret.

// Added some better sounds to the guns which should hopefully be a bit less bland.

// Added integrated ammunition to most turrets which lacked it before and appear to be able to physically fit actual ammo inside them.  The amount will need to be tweaked in the future per turret but the idea is to cut down on how many ammo bins people need to bring while still making it a need that people have to balance and design the tanks around.

//fixed the broken TOW hitting the ground (set the height manually using the BDA setting to something very low like 50 or 100m AGL)

//added HEAT ammo as an alternative choice for anti-tank duty, it is balanced to be far more destructive to armor itself (HP damage) while having less penetration, low velocity and being interceptable by the APS system.  Its strong at point blank ranges and will evicerate anything with sub 100mm plating but takes alot of hits to take down a heavy tank's armor panels.
