		//SNOOP-7
		#LOC_KPDynamics_SnoopLarge_title = SNOOP-7(V)3 Large Phased Array Radar
		#LOC_KPDynamics_SnoopLarge_description = The THE/SNOOP-7(V)3 is the largest single phased array radar system ever built. With a fearsome 37 individual scanning cells, it is capable of detecting targets, tracking targets, frying electronics, frying kerbals and frying itself. 
		#LOC_KPDynamics_SnoopLarge_radar = SNOOP-7 Large
		#LOC_KPDynamics_SnoopSmall_title = SNOOP-7(V)1 Small Phased Array Radar
		#LOC_KPDynamics_SnoopSmall_description = The THE/SNOOP-7(V)1 packs cutting edge AESA architecture into a small form factor - with only 9 scanning cells, it is so weak that its operation doesn't pose a danger to anyone - in fact it barely does anything at all!

		#LOC_KPDynamics_Simpson_title = "SIMPSON" Multi-Function Radar
		#LOC_KPDynamics_Simpson_description = While designing this radar, the engineers initially made some mistakes, made some assumptions that were incorrect, and failed out loud, but the SIMPSON is now ready for market. A solid state AESA radar capable of tracking hundreds of targets, it can perform multiple roles but is optimised as the fire control component of a naval air defence system.

		//Lynx
		#LOC_KPDynamics_Lynx_title = KP41 "Axe" IFV Turret
		#LOC_KPDynamics_Lynx_description = The KP41 "Axe" is a versatile IFV turret outfitted with a burst-fire autocannon. Initial designs limited bursts to three and asked "why not more" only for the barrel to melt.
		#LOC_KPDynamics_Lynx_weapon = Axe
		#LOC_KPDynamics_Lynx_Variant_Manned = Manned
		#LOC_KPDynamics_Lynx_Variant_Unanned = Unmanned
		
		//40mm
		#LOC_KPDynamics_40_title = 40mm Mk4 Naval Gun
		#LOC_KPDynamics_40_description = This light naval gun fires 40mm ammunition. Manufactured by Gladia Ordnance & Ballistics, a subsidiary of Gladia Fleetworks, it can be purchased with one of two different shrouds - the basic, cheap and boring standard mount of yesterday, or the flashy, monolithic and expensive stealth mount of tomorrow.\n\n<color=orange>PFHE is a mass fragmentation round with a customisable Prox fuse and best used against missiles. GP explodes and burns targets, AP penetrates up to 110mm RHA.</color>

		#LOC_KPDynamics_57_description = This light naval gun fires 57mm ammunition. Manufactured by Gladia Ordnance & Ballistics, a subsidiary of Gladia Fleetworks, it can be purchased with one of two different shrouds - the basic, cheap and boring standard mount of yesterday, or the flashy, monolithic and expensive stealth mount of tomorrow. \n\n<color=orange>Estimated 45% accuracy against a 2x2 target at 8500m. Standard shell simulates proximty HE.</color>

		//76mm
		#LOC_KPDynamics_76_title = 76mm Mk62 Naval Gun
		#LOC_KPDynamics_76_description = This midrange naval gun fires 76mm ammunition. Manufactured by Gladia Ordnance & Ballistics, a subsidiary of Gladia Fleetworks, it can be outfitted in a variety of configurations - the longstanding domed model, smaller but antiquated with a high radar profile, or the modern and "Super-Rapid" (does not make you go faster) outfits.\n\n<color=orange>\Use the GP round to make things burn and explode, PLA-P to penetrate moderately armoured targets. PF-HE comes with a customisable Prox fuse but has little to no armour piercing.</color>

		#LOC_KPDynamics_127_description = This medium naval gun was made by the Gladia Fleetworks subsidiary Gladia Ordnance & Ballistics and fires 127mm (5in) shells. It is well suited for destroyers, as it can destroy things quite well.\n\n<color=orange>GP comes with explosive and incendiary magic and SAP detonates after embedding in the target's armour. Cargo round sprays 40 submunitions in a wide cone, please do not use this against tanks.</color>
		#LOC_KPDynamics_127_weapon = 127mm Naval

		#LOC_KPDynamics_155_title = 155mm Mk51 Primitive Gun System
		#LOC_KPDynamics_155_description = This large naval gun was made by the Gladia Fleetworks subsidiary Gladia Ordnance & Ballistics. It fires 155mm artillery shells. Due to its primitive nature its development program was exceptionally fast, inexpensive and untroubled.
