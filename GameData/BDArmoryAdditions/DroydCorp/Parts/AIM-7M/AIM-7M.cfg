	%title = AIM-7 Sparrow Missile
	%description = Semi-active radar homing air-to-air missile. Entered service in the US in 1982. The latest model Sparrow makes some minor improvements to the previous version's seeker and warhead but otherwise leaves the general feel and capabilities of the 7F intact. The penultimate version of the Sparrow is a glimpse into the 4th generation, a world where weapons and the know-how to use them is what determines the winner of any engagement.
